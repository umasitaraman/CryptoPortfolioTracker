# Crypto Portfolio Tracker

Crypto assets are digital tokens secured through a decentralized computer network. Owning several crypto 
assets can be difficult to track and view overall value and performance.

The crypto portfolio tracking service provides a custom view of the client's portfolio to meet their needs. 
It is designed to connect with a 3rd party cryptocurrency data aggregator, displaying realtime data converted 
to USD for accurate asset value. 

This will keep track of all assets in a single location with historical data of transactions to view growth 
and regression.

We use API Gateway and Lambda to create seven endpoints (RegisterActivity, LoginActivity, VerifyActivity, 
CreatePortfolioActivity, GetPortfolioActivity, UpdatePortfolioActivity, GetTransactionActivity) that will 
handle the creation, update, and retrieval of portfolio to satisfy our requirements.

We store the user profile, portfolio, and transaction history in DynamoBD tables where we also designed
a GSI schema and attribute projection that optimizes queries for the transactions.

CryptoPortfolioTracker also provides a web interface for users to manage their portfolios. A main page providing a list view will let them create new portfolios and link off to pages to update and view assets.

P.S : This was a team project and my contribution to the project was implementing the backend code for VerifyActivity, CreatePortfolioActivity, GetPortfolioActivity, UpdatePortfolioActivity, GetTransactionActivity end points
